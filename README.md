## How It Works

1. **Upload PDFs**: Drag and drop receipt files into the browser
2. **Extract Data**: PDF text is parsed to identify invoice details
3. **AI Analysis**: Ollama processes line items and assigns categories
4. **Cache Results**: Analyzed data is cached locally for instant reloading
5. **Visualize**: Dashboard shows spending trends and category breakdowns

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **AI**: Ollama with Gemma2:27b (local LLM)
- **PDF**: pdf2json for text extraction
- **Storage**: File-based caching with JSON

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/receipts/all` - Analyze all PDFs
- `GET /api/receipts/cache` - Retrieve cached results
- `POST /api/files/upload` - Upload new PDFs
- `GET /api/pdf/extract` - Extract invoice data

## Development

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Ollama
ollama serve

# Terminal 2: Start Next.js
npm run dev
```

## Privacy First

All processing happens locally. No data leaves your machine. Your invoices, analysis results, and spending patterns remain private.
